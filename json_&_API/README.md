### What is JSON?

JSON stands for '**J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation' and is a text format that follows a similar syntax to Javascript object creation.  
<br>
Its primary focus is the storing and transferring of data which can be easily achieved due to its text-only format.  
<br>
JSON can store the following data types:  
* Strings
* Numbers
  * No distinction between integers and floats
* JSON Objects
* Booleans
* Array 
  * Can be of any datatype but cannot contain multiple different data types
* null value

The data is stored in a 'name: value' format.

`{"fname": "John"}` - String  
`{"age": 25}` - Number  
`{"verified": true}` - Boolean  
`"numbers":[25, 30, 35]` - Array  
`{homephone": null}` - null  
`profile: {"firstname": "John", "lastname": "Doe", "age": 25}` - JSON Object
